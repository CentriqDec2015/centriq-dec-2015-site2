@section BioContent {
    I believe I can benefit any organization through the values I gained as a United States Marine.
    At the core of those values are leadership,creative problem solving, an unrelenting drive for success, and above all the ability to excel through teamwork. I was a small business owner for the last 10 years so I understand the importance of the bottom line and how to use all available resources to achieve it,
    as well as the drive to discover new ways to help my team and me function at its' full potential.
