@section BioContent {
    My name is Andrew Allen, I have spent the past years out of high school working in environments revolving around 
    teamwork and providing the best customer experience. I have always loved technology and it seemed to be the only 
    field that I was interested in. I was told about Centriq Training through a friend, and finally was able to pursue a 
    career in Web Development. I love being able to add uniqueness and creativity to projects and seeing what I achieved 
    in the end. I enjoy learning knew things everyday to help expand my knowledge and capabilities in this field. It is very 
    satisfying to see all your hard work pay off in the end. I'm looking forward to using my experience in the field and 
    showing you what I'm capable of accomplishing.
