@section BioContent {
    I graduated from the University of Missouri- Kansas City in 2010 with a Bachelor's of Science in Accounting. Before this, I spent five years on Active Duty in the Marine Corps. I deployed four times in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. I handled secondary repairables in the supply field. This means that I dealt with ordering, tracking, receiving, researching, issuing and storing items as wide ranging as vehicle alternators to weapons sights, from circuit card assemblies to Tank Engine/ Transmission assembly. Anything the Marine Corps thought should be cost efficient to repair is what I dealt with. It was fun while it lasted, but I decided to do one term and get out.

    I work at the same Consumer Fireworks Company now, that I did when I was in high school and prior to the Marine Corps. Although, now I run the company, and before I just did whatever I was told. This means that I handle all cash receipts and cash disbursements, handle everything that deals with inventory, and handle all required permits and filings, and anything else that you would think selling in an empty field for a week would require. Trust me, it's more than you'd think.

    I decided that I have enough time and my GI Bill is about to lapse, so I came to Centriq to learn a new skill. The time I have spent here has been very educational. I've learned so much in such a short term. I would definitely recommend this track to any of my friends or relatives considering a move into this field.
