@section BioContent {
    For over eight years I worked as an adjuster in auto insurance.  This experience taught me to be organized and diligent 
    in a fast-paced environment where teamwork and flexibility are key.  I really enjoyed the opportunities I had to work 
    with cross-department teams to evaluate and improve organizational processes.  My desire to learn new skills and find 
    new avenues for professional growth has led me to a career change.  I'm attending Centriq so that I can join a growing 
    and changing industry that will provide challenges to further my professional growth. I have really enjoyed learning 
    how to build applications, particularly with MVC.  I look forward to finding a position that will allow me to develop 
    my skills and contribute to positive outcomes.
