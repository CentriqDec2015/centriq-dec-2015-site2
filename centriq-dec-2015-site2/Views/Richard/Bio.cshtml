@section BioContent {
    <p>I have always had a passion for computers and coding and a love of technology. My programming experience began in 1983 on an Apple IIe. I was in junior high school. After earning my bachelor’s degree, I spent time operating my own business creating custom database applications for the publishing industry.</p>
    <p>For more than 20 years, I worked as the editor and media director for a major nonprofit and was in charge of supervising, organizing, and maintaining five association websites, as well as the social media presence for the organization. I was also responsible for all of the print media efforts of the organization. I worked successfully with a very broad range of people, from accountants to artists and from business owners to potential clients of member businesses. I am very proud that I was able to organize and present huge amounts of data to the targeted end users in such a way that it was understandable and accessible to them.</p>
    <p>In recent months, I have gained new skills and updated others through Centriq’s .Net Application Developer program. I look forward to putting my skills and experience to work coding in an environment that offers opportunity to encounter many challenges and discover solutions that meet and exceed the needs and expectations of the end user.</p>
