@section BioContent {
    If you didn't know by now my name is Jason. I grew up around the Kansas City area. I attended Platte County R-III high school where I hold several school records in Track and Field as well as 2 state championships. I received a Track and Field scholarship at Northwest Missouri State University and held All Conference Honors. I graduated in 2011 and pursued a career in law enforcement. I enjoy working with people but I always had a great passion to learn about programming.

Throughout my life I have enjoyed working with computers and technology. It wasn't until 2015 when I hopped on code academy for the first time and wrote my own code. I found that I really enjoy computer programming and enrolled in the .NET Development track at Centriq Training. While attending Centriq I have learned many valuable skills, languages, and have made a lot of awesome friends! I am excited to see what the future brings and I am very excited to have a career as a computer programmer.
