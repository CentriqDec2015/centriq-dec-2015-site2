@section BioContent {
    I am Lillian Fleming; a bold, risk-taking career changer. After finishing my capstone year in Germany I landed in Kansas City and began my career in the financial services industry at the very beginning of the financial recession. Over the next six years I worked my way up from part-time clerk to senior stockbroker for high-net-worth clients through professional and personal development.

    Seeking to create an opportunity for expanding my career and pursuing my passion for multi-disciplinary problem solving, I enrolled in Centriq. Being a .NET application developer provides a synthesis of my skills in complex client-communications and critical thinking.
