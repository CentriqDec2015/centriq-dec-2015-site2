@section BioContent {
    I’ve been a tech nerd for as long as I can remember. In high school I was heavily into modifying games 
    and making cool stuff on the computer, and I got a job in my Jr. year at a Verizon store where I was promoted to sales manager 
    only 6 months in. The owner relied on me for managing the entire inventory and point of sale system, as well as creating 
    financial reports in Excel at the end of each day. After Verizon I worked as a Search Engine Evaluator where I learned a lot 
    about what search engines are looking for in websites in terms of design as well as content and presentation. After a little 
    community college I decided that I wanted to code for a living, but the classes were moving too slowly for me. So here I am 
    with Centriq, fully embracing my passion for code.
