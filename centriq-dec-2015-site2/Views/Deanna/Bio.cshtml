@section BioContent {
    In previous positions, I've had the opportunity to set and regularly exceed sales and service goals. As an assistant manager for a busy restaurant, I learned how to efficiently supervise and maintain the relationships between managers, staff, vendors, and customers.

Currently in training to become a .NET developer, I'm eager to obtain a position where I can utilize my new skill set. I find myself challenged and fascinated with the ever-growing industry of technology and can't wait to begin my new career as a developer.
